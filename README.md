# Welcome to Vatpy
Vatpy (Visualisation of Arepo in the Terminal using PYthon) is a light-weight, highly customisable, visualisation tool-kit
for astrophysical simulations performed using the Arepo code (Springel 2010). Many of its functionalities can be generally
applied to simulations made by Arepo (as long as the output is in HDF5-format), however, more specific capabilities, such as
creating visual maps of the gas chemistry, is at the moment only adapted to simulations run using the ArepoNoctua numerical
framework (Petersson et al. 2025).

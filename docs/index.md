# Welcome to Vatpy

Vatpy (Visualisation of Arepo in the Terminal using PYthon) is a light-weight,
highly customisable, visualisation tool-kit for astrophysical simulations
performed using the Arepo code (Springel 2010). 

Many of its functionalities can be generally applied to simulations made by Arepo
(as long as the output is in HDF5-format), however, more specific capabilities, 
such as creating visual maps of the gas chemistry, is at the moment only adapted
to simulations run using the ArepoNoctua numerical framework (Petersson et al. 2025).
